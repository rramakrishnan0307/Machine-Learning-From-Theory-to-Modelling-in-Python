# aicamp-Machine-Learning-From-Theory-to-Modelling-in-Python

This course was taught by Ali Madani and Farnoosh Khodakarami. Here are the details of the milestone project:

Implement supervised learning, dimensionality reduction and clustering models in Python. There are two datasets considered for this project including:

1)Breast Cancer Dataset
    
    a)Available through sklearn (use load_breast_cancer as part of sklearn)
    b)Link to the original dataset​:http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic)
    c)Name​: Wisconsin breast cancer dataset
    d)Summary​: Identifying if there is a malignant tumor or not using featuresthat are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
    e)number of features​: 30 (real, positive)
    f)Number of data points (instances)​: 569
    g)dataset accessibility​: Dataset is available as part of sklearn package.
 
 2)Facebook metrics Dataset
    
    a)Download the file form the link and read it in python using pandas
    b)Link to the dataset​:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Facebook+Live+Sellers+in+Thailand
    c)Name​: Facebook Live Sellers in Thailand dataset
    d)Summary​: Posts of a different nature (video, photos, statuses, and links) onFacebook pages of 10 Thai fashion and cosmetics retail sellers.
    e)Number of features​: 12 (we will work with 9 columns as features)
    f)Number of data points (instances)​: 7051 (we will work with the first 1000 data points (rows))
